<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I like my dog, cross-stitching, embroidery, video games, reading, and boba.</p>

<p>I am a recent graduate with an associate's in multimedia and digital arts, I am an aspiring web designer and developer but I feel like the developing part is catching more of my interest so far.</p>

<p>I am currently looking for work and building my skillset as I do it. There's always something new to learn.</p>
